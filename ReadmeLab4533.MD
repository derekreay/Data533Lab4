This suite is for the creation of pitcher and batters as objects and calculating rate stats common in baseball.  

In our automated testing we had relatively low coverage ~90% this was due to the presence of many if else statements to handle poor data input and prevent both calculating errors related to division
and to prevent stats impossible in baseball. In our test suites we did not test all the if else statements so our coverage suffered.
